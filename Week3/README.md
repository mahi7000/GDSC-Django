This is a readme for Week 3

## Tasks
Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.<br>
- Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space<br>
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits<br>
- The last number should be followed by a new line<br>
- You can only use no more than 2 print functions with string format<br>
- You can only use one loop in your code<br>
- You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable<br>
- You are not allowed to import any module<br><br>
Write a program that prints the following pattern.<br>
- The program should accept the input for character<br>
- The pattern consists of a series of lines<br>
- The characters in each line should follow a specific pattern based on the line number.<br>
- Use conditional statements to determine the pattern for each line.<br>
- Use a loop to iterate through the lines and print the characters accordingly.<br>
- You are not allowed to use functions in your code.<br>
- Do not store the pattern or any intermediate results in variables.<br><br>

Develop a program that checks if a user-inputted word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "radar").<br><br>

Write a Python program to find and print the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 50 (inclusive). Additionally, for each even number, if it is a multiple of 3, print "Three" instead of the number; if it is a multiple of 5, print "Five" instead of the number. Finally, print the total sum and the count of numbers replaced with "Three" or "Five."
