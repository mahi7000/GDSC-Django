# Library Management System Project
### Project Overview:
Build a command-line-based library management system where users can perform operations such as adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and viewing book details. The system should use OOP principles to model entities like books, users, and transactions.
### Project Requirements:
###### Book Class:
Create a Book class with attributes such as title, author, ISBN, and availability_status.
Implement methods for displaying book details and updating the availability status.

###### User Class:
Create a User class with attributes like user_id, name, and books_borrowed.
Implement methods for displaying user details, borrowing books, and returning books.

###### Library Class:
Create a Library class to manage the collection of books and user information.
Implement methods for adding books to the library, registering new users, and handling book transactions.

###### Transaction Class:
Create a Transaction class to represent book transactions (borrowing and returning).
Implement methods for recording transactions and generating transaction reports.

###### Command-Line Interface:
Implement a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the library system.
Allow users to perform actions like adding books, registering users, borrowing books, returning books, and viewing reports.
